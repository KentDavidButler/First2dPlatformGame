Trying out using unity to create a platform game

This is my first test using  unity to create a simple scrolling platform game. I've always been interested in games such as Super Mario
Brother, Super Meat Boy, as well as other similar style platform style games. Some of the challenges I'll be working through is using 
sprites purchased from Itch.IO, getting basic movement functioning and having the animations work with that movement, getting correct 
collision detection working, and trying to create multipule levels.

We will see how it goes!
